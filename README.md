•ATTENTION! The program works correctly only if you haven't edited the cache path.<br>
 If you've edited it you must change the path in the code.<br>

•The program is developed with AutoHotKey, you can find the code at: 12345.<br>
 To see and edit the code you must have AutoHotKey installed on your pc.<br>

•Some programs may not work correctly after the cache cleaning or they require log-in.<br>
 I take no responsibility in case of malfunction.<br>
 It's always recommended to make a backup of the data of the programs before cleaning.<br>
